This is perhaps not too surprising, given what we know about hourly temperatures. Generally, the temperature in a given hour will be quite closely related to the temperature in the previous hour. This phenomenon is very common in time-series analysis and is known as autocorrelation - that is, the time series is correlated with previous values of itself. More precisely, the values at time t are correlated with lagged values (which could be t-1, t-2 and so on).\n","\n","Another thing we saw previously is the concept of moving averages. In this case the moving-average baseline was not that good at prediction. However it is common in many time-series for a moving average to capture some of the underlying structure and be useful for prediction.\n","\n","In order to make our model better at predicting temperature, ideally we would want to take these aspects into account. Fortunately, the statistical community has a long history of analyzing time series and has created many different forecasting models.\n","\n","Here, we will explore one called SARIMAX - the Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors model.\n","\n","This sounds like a very complex name, but if we look at the components of the name, we see that it includes autocorrelation (this is what auto regressive means) and moving averages, which are the components mentioned above.\n","\n","The SARIMAX model also allows including a seasonal model component as well as handling exogenous variables, which are external to the time-series value itself.

In practice, our time-series model will not have a weight of exactly 1 (though it will likely be very close to that), hence the predictions will be slightly different.\n","\n","Now, lets fit our model to the dataset.
